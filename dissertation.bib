  abstract   = {The article describes an IDE for functional programming, called WinHIPE. It provides an interactive and flexible tracer, as well as a powerful visualization and animation system. The former tool is based on the rewriting model of evaluation, and the latter provides automatic generation of visualizations and animations, friendly support for customization, maintenance and exportation of animations to the Web, and facilities to cope with large scale. Its main advantage over other visualization systems is an effortless approach to animation creation and maintenance, based on generating visualizations and animations automatically, as a side effect of program execution. Finally, we briefly describe our experience using the system during several years in educational settings.},
