\chapter{Lifecycle}
The project followed a development lifecycle inspired by Agile principles\cite{agilemanifesto2001}, structured into four iterative cycles. Each cycle built upon the last, integrating evaluation and feedback to continuously and rapidly refine the features and the UI/UX of the system. 

Each cycle was further subdivided into four phases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirements Gathering
    \item Design and Research
    \item Implementation
    \item Evaluation
\end{itemize}

In particular, the project benefitted from agile principles emphasising:
