\chapter*{Abstract}
Students often find functional programming languages more difficult to learn than imperative languages, and they they may struggle to gain an intuitive understanding of how functional languages are evaluated. I have created a tool \href{https://functional.kiransturt.co.uk}{SFL Explorer} which aims to build students intuitive understanding of how functional programming languages work

includes my own typechecked functional programming language SFL. SFL is a very minimal language, but it includes many standard functional language features

\chapter*{Dedication and Acknowledgements}
My supervisors, Jess Foster and Sarah Connolly, have been unwaveringly helpful, supportive and kind throughout this project, as well as my university journey as a whole. I would like to thank them for all of their help, without which this would not have been possible. 

I would like to thank Samantha Frohlich for being a really great client, who's enthusiasm for what I was creating really inspired me to do my best work. I would also like to thank Dr. Steven Ramsey for being a fantastic lecturer in programming languages; this project would not have been anywhere near as good without the knowledge and inspiration I gained from his lectures.

\noindent
\begin{itemize}
\item I used React (\url{https://react.dev/}) to develop the website for this project.
\item The bindings for the web assembly interface to the library for the language were generated by using macros from the wasm-pack rust crate: \url{https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack}.
\item I used GitHub Copilot to help assist with generating unit tests.
