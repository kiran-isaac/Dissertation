    \caption{rust-like psuedocode listing for the type of the output of the AST::diff function, as well as a small section of the algorithm. There is also (not shown) a wrapper around the Diff type, to allow for conversion into JavaScript (see \ref{bg:wasm}), as well as the some logic for combining diffs.}
